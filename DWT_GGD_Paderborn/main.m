% Ð¡heck out the path variable in LoadFromK function
% 
% If the number of features has changed, 
% you need to change the variable N_features in LoadFromK respectively
% 
% LoadFromK contains RMS normalization of signal
% change it if necessary
% 
% Output of GetFeatures function is array of doubles

% Warnings occur from the fact that parameters in fitGGD code are changing
